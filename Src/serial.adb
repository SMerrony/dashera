-- Note the serial break does not seem to be provided by GNAT.Serial_Communications
-- It is claimed that...
--
-- Sending break can be achieved by:
--
-- * lowering the bit-rate
-- * sending 0x00 which will seem as break.
-- * change bit-rate back.
--
-- During the break, it won't be possible to receive data since the bit-rate is not correct.
